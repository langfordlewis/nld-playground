## How to Run Each Project

### Frontend Projects (00, 01, 03)

1. Open the project folder in VS Code.  

2. Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or use the **Live Server** extension for auto-refresh.  

### React Project (02)

1. Open the project folder in VS Code.  

2. Install dependencies: npm install

3. Start the dev server: npm run dev

4. Open the URL shown in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

### Node Backend Project (04)

1. Open the project folder in VS Code.  

2. Install dependencies: npm install

3. Start the server: node index.jsx

4. Check your terminal for server logs (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

## Tips

- Use **one terminal per project** if running multiple dev servers simultaneously.  

- Stop a running server with `Ctrl+C` (Mac/Windows) before starting another in the same terminal.  

- Use **VS Code Markdown preview** (`Cmd+Shift+V` on Mac, `Ctrl+Shift+V` on Windows) to view this README nicely.  

- Keep projects self-contained to avoid dependency conflicts.  

- Regularly commit your work with Git for version control.
